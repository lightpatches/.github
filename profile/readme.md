# what are lightpatches?

“lightpatch” is a dumb name I came up with in five minutes for the dumb idea I had to make patches of video games and other software that would make the amount of space they take up on disk smaller. I’m focusing on already-smaller games, not the 50+&nbsp;gigabyte behemoths, for now. My first project I’m working on is _Celeste_.
